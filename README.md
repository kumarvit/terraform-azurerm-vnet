Terraform Module to create a set of Azure network resources. Few of these resources added/excluded as per your requirement.

These types of resources are supported:

* [Virtual Network](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/virtual_network.html)

* [Subnets](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/subnet.html)

* [AzureNetwork DDoS Protection Plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/network_ddos_protection_plan.html)

* [Network Watcher](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/network_watcher.html)

## Module Usage

Following example to create a virtual network with subnets, DDoS protection plan, and network watcher resources.

```
module "vnet" {
  source                  = "github.com/tietoevry-infra-as-code/terraform-azurerm-vnet?ref=v1.0.0"
  create_resource_group   = false

# Using Custom names and VNet/subnet Address Prefix (Recommended)
  resource_group_name     = "rg-demo-westeurope-01"
  vnetwork_name           = "vnet-demo-westeurope-001"
  location                = "westeurope"
  vnet_address_space      = ["10.1.0.0/16"]
  private_subnets         = ["snet-app01","snet-app01"]
  subnet_address_prefix   = ["10.1.2.0/24","10.1.3.0/24"]

# Adding Network watcher, and custom DNS servers (Optional)
  create_ddos_plan        = false
  dns_servers             = []

# Adding TAG's to your Azure resources (Required)
  tags = {
    Terraform   = "true"
    Environment = "dev"
    Owner       = "test-user"
  }
}
```

## Create resource group

By default, this module will not create a resource group and the name of an existing resource group to be given in an argument `create_resource_group`. If you want to create a new resource group, set the argument `create_resource_group = true`.

*If you are using an existing resource group, then this module uses the same resource group location to create all resources in this module.*

## Azure Network DDoS Protection Plan

By default, this module will not create a DDoS Protection Plan. You can enable it by appending an argument `create_ddos_plan`. If you want to create a DDoS plan using this module, set argument `create_ddos_plan = true`

## Subnets

This module handles creation and a list of address spaces for subnets. Subnet creation is using `for_each` in resources new in terraform 0.12.6 and will be updated in future versions. When creating subnets, there is no way to "attach" them to a security group using this module. It is a conscious choice because of the deprecation of that field.

Instead use [Subnet security group association](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/subnet_network_security_group_association.html) outside the module.

It is also possible to add other routes to the associated route tables outside of this module.

## Network Watcher

This module handle the provision of Network Watcher. Note that you cannot create more than one network watcher resource per subscription in any region.

By default, this enabled. You can exclude this from the Terraform plan using `create_network_watcher = false` argument in case you already have a network watcher available in your subscription.

## Tagging

Use tags to organize your Azure resources and management hierarchy. You can apply tags to your Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair. For example, you can apply the name "Environment" and the value "Production" to all the resources in production. You can manage these values variables directly or mapping as a variable using `variables.tf`.

All Azure resources which support tagging can be tagged by specifying key-values in argument `tags`. Tag Name is added automatically on all resources. For example, you can specify `tags` like this:

```
module "vnet" {
  source        = "github.com/tietoevry-infra-as-code/terraform-azurerm-vnet?ref=v1.0.0"
  create_resource_group   = false

  # ... omitted

  tags = {
    Terraform   = "true"
    Environment = "dev"
    Owner       = "test-user"
  }
}  
```
